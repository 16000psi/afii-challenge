# AFII Django Trade Platform ðŸ’½

This is a trade capture system built using Python, Django and JavaScript. Its main page is a web application containing three sections - a form for submitting new trades, a trade blotter for editing trades before they are committed, and a graph section for displaying information about committed trades. 

## Features

### User Registration and Login

To use the application, the user must first create an account. After registration, they will be prompted to log in.

### New Trade Submission

- **New Trade Form**: The user can create new trades in the "New Trade" section. The form features a radio selector to designate the instrument type of the trade.


### Trade Blotter

- **Edit Trades**: Trades appear in the "Trade Blotter" section. To edit a trade, the user can click on the pencil icon in the "Action" column of the table. This will open a form where the trade's details can be modified.
- **Delete Trades**: Trades can be deleted by clicking the delete button on the edit form or the rubbish bin icon in the "Action" column.
- **Commit Trades**: Once the user is satisfied with their staged trades, click the "Upload Trades" button to commit them to the backend.

### Graph Section

- **Trade Analytics**: The graph section displays information about all committed trades in the system, from all users.
- **Historical Data**: A dropdown menu allows the user to select and view trades up to five years in the past.
- **Graphical Insights**:
  - **Distribution of Trades**: The top graph shows the distribution of trades by instrument type or strategy (selectable from a dropdown) over the selected time period.
  - **Volume Analysis**: The second graph allows the user to select an individual instrument type and view the spread of trade volume for a given numerical field's value.
